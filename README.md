# Neural Networks from Scratch in `X`

The idea here is to share [Neural Networks from Scratch tutorial parts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3) / [Neural Networks from Scratch book](https://nnfs.io) in various other programming languages, besides just Python. 

If you're following along in another language, feel free to contribute to your specific language via a pull request. If you're considering trying to use another language, you can see how others have achieved writing the neural networks from scratch in other languages here too.

The basic idea behind a neural network is to simulate (copy in a simplified but reasonably faithful way) lots of densely interconnected brain cells inside a computer so you can get it to learn things, recognize patterns, and make decisions in a humanlike way. The amazing thing about a neural network is that you don't have to program it to learn explicitly: it learns all by itself, just like a brain!

But it isn't a brain. It's important to note that neural networks are (generally) software simulations: they're made by programming very ordinary computers, working in a very traditional fashion with their ordinary transistors and serially connected logic gates, to behave as though they're built from billions of highly interconnected brain cells working in parallel. No-one has yet attempted to build a computer by wiring up transistors in a densely parallel structure exactly like the human brain. In other words, a neural network differs from a human brain in exactly the same way that a computer model of the weather differs from real clouds, snowflakes, or sunshine. Computer simulations are just collections of algebraic variables and mathematical equations linking them together (in other words, numbers stored in boxes whose values are constantly changing). They mean nothing whatsoever to the computers they run insideâ€”only to the people who program them.


# How to contribute: 

The plan is to share code from video part #s. I will be updating the Python variants, so, if you are just following the [book](https://nnfs.io), you can see which block(s) of code should be translated by checking out the Python versions.

Before submitting a PR, check to see if there's already a PR from someone for that specific part # and language. 

I will be accepting PRs in the following ways:

1. Prioritizing the already-established people who have contributed to that language already.
2. Prioritizing by who submits first.
